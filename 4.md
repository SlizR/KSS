# Boot Flow – How the System Gets Started

Boot flow is the chain of events from the moment power is applied until control is transferred to the kernel.

### Important to Understand

A computer **cannot run programs on its own**. It has no concept of "file," "kernel," or "OS." It can only:

* power on
* execute instructions at a predetermined address

### General Boot Logic

1. **Power is applied**

* the processor is reset to its initial state
* registers are set to fixed values
* control is transferred to a predetermined address

2. **Initial Environment Code**

* this is not an operating system
* it is minimal
* its task is to prepare the launch of the next stage

3. **Boot Loader**

* finds the kernel
* loads it into memory
* prepares the environment
* transfers control to the kernel

4. **Kernel**

* from this point on, the system is "alive"
* is further controlled by the kernel

### Why is this important

The kernel **does not boot first**. It always arrives at an already partially prepared environment and must be able to:

* accept control
* continue initialization
* not rely on anything "ready-made"
