# CPU and Processor Modes

A processor is more than just an "executor." It has **access levels** and **operating modes**.

### Why modes are needed

If any program could:

* manage memory
* disable devices
* change processor settings

the system would be insecure and unstable.

### Key Ideas

* **Privileged Mode**

* full access to everything
* used by the kernel
* **Restricted Mode**

* a limited set of instructions
* used by user programs

### What a processor mode does

It determines:

* what instructions are allowed
* what memory areas can be accessed
* whether devices can be controlled directly

### Why the kernel is special

The kernel:

* runs in the most privileged mode
* controls transitions between modes
* protects the system from application errors
