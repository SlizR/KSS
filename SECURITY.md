# **Security Policy**

## **Supported Versions**

KSS is a documentation-driven project. Security updates primarily focus on correcting technical inaccuracies that could lead to insecure system implementations or addressing vulnerabilities in the documentation deployment infrastructure.

| Version | Supported |
| --- | --- |
| 278 (Current) | **Yes** |
| < 100 | **Not usable** |

*Note: As KSS is an educational roadmap, we prioritize the latest revision of the documentation to ensure the most secure and up-to-date principles are being taught.*

## **Reporting a Vulnerability**

We take the security and integrity of our architectural guidance seriously. If you find a vulnerability—whether it is a flaw in the suggested logic that could compromise a built kernel or a security issue within the project repository—please follow the procedure below:

### **How to Report**

1. **Do not open a public Issue.** To prevent the exploitation of a potential flaw before it is fixed, please report vulnerabilities privately.
2. Send a detailed report to the project maintainer via the official contact channels (e.g., email or secure messaging provided by **Sliz®**).
3. Include a clear description of the vulnerability, its potential impact, and steps to reproduce or identify it within the documentation.

### **Response Process**

* **Acknowledgement:** You can expect an initial response acknowledging your report within **48–72 hours**.
* **Evaluation:** Our team will investigate the report to determine its validity and impact on the KSS/SSS ecosystem.
* **Resolution:** If the vulnerability is accepted, we will work on a correction. You will be notified once the documentation has been updated and the fix is merged via a Pull Request.
* **Public Disclosure:** After the fix is applied, we may credit the reporter in the commit history (unless anonymity is requested).

### **Policy on AI and Automated Scans**

Reports generated solely by automated security scanners or AI without human verification and a clear proof-of-concept for the KSS context will be declined.
