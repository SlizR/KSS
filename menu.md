# **What is KSS anyway?**

**KSS (Kernel Step by Step)** is an open-source documentation project designed for those who want to build their own kernel from the ground up. Unlike other resources, KSS doesn't teach you how to simply modify Linux or MS-DOS; it empowers you to create something entirely unique—from scratch—whether it's a hobby project or a proprietary system.

The documentation covers the entire lifecycle of a kernel: from its fundamental architecture to the complex logic and design principles that make it function.

**Our Philosophy:** KSS is built on clarity. We want you to truly understand *why* a piece of code exists and *how* it functions. Our goal is to inspire original creation. Instead of "cloning and renaming" existing kernels without understanding the internal mechanics, KSS provides the knowledge to innovate and build your own vision. We believe that true "coolness" comes from understanding your work, not just making it work with stolen code.

## **Who is KSS made for?**

KSS is crafted for aspiring developers, students, and OS enthusiasts who have always dreamed of building their own operating system. It is specifically designed for those who:

* **Want to understand the "magic":** Deep dive into what happens behind the screen.  
* **Desire Originality:** Build from scratch without over-reliance on AI or copy-pasting someone else's project and claiming it as their own.  
* **Take Pride in Ownership:** Create a kernel that is truly yours, based on your own logic and principles.

## **What makes KSS different? (KSS vs. LFS)**

While projects like **LFS (Linux From Scratch)** are legendary, KSS offers a different approach:

* **Guided Roadmap vs. Encyclopedia:** LFS is a massive encyclopedia that can be dense, confusing, and often assumes you are already a veteran developer with years of programming experience. KSS is a structured, point-by-point roadmap that explains the "What" and the "Why" at every stage.  
* **Beyond the Kernel:** KSS doesn't stop at the kernel. It bridges the gap between low-level development and high-level OS features, even providing fundamental programming lessons to help you along the way.  
* **Focused Logic:** While LFS focuses on assembling a Linux distribution, KSS focuses on the pure logic required to build *your* kernel or an OS based on your own unique architecture.

## **From Kernel to Operating System**

You might notice "Kernel" in our name, but our scope is wider. **KSS (Kernel Step by Step)** focuses on the heart of the system—the kernel. However, a kernel needs a environment to interact with.

Once you complete the KSS roadmap, you will find a transition to **SSS (System Step by Step)**. This secondary phase teaches you how to take that core (your own kernel or even a third-party one) and build a full-fledged Operating System around it—complete with your own shell, commands, programs, and unique features.

# **What is SSS?**

**SSS (System Step by Step)** is the natural evolution of your journey. It is the documentation dedicated to building the "User Space" and the environment around the kernel. SSS guides you through:

* Creating a custom **Command Shell**.  
* Developing system **programs and utilities**.  
* Implementing unique OS features and user interfaces.

**Note:** SSS is not a separate entity; it is a specialized branch of the KSS ecosystem created by **Sliz®**. You can continue your journey here: [SSS](https://kernelstepbystep.pp.ua/os/)
