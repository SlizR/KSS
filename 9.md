# Timers - a source of time

A timer is a device that regularly generates events.

### Why is it needed?

A timer allows you to:

* measure time
* switch tasks
* prevent freezes

### Key idea

A timer is the "heartbeat" of the system.

Every tick:

* the kernel gains control
* can make decisions
* can change the task being executed

### Without a timer

* no multitasking
* no fair CPU distribution
* the system is unmanageable
