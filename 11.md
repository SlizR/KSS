# Debugging - When Nothing Works

Debugging in a low-level environment is a special discipline.

### Reality

* No Error Messages
* no windows
* no default logs

### What is considered an "error"

* freezing
* reboot
* black screen
* no response

### The role of the kernel

The kernel should:

* be able to detect critical errors
* stop the system gracefully
* provide minimal indication of the system's state

### Why you need to know this in advance

Without understanding debugging, a person:

* doesn't understand what went wrong
* can't distinguish a logic error from an architectural error
* gets stuck for months
