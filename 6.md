# Memory is the foundation of the system

Memory is the **main resource** managed by the kernel.

### Important Concepts

* **Physical Memory** — actual RAM
* **Addresses** — the numbers by which the processor accesses memory
* **Address Space** — the set of addresses that the code "sees"

### Why You Can't Work Directly

If different parts of the system:

* write to the same addresses
* don't recognize each other's boundaries

this leads to data corruption and crashes.

### The Role of the Kernel

The Kernel:

* decides which memory is available to which users
* prevents conflicts
* creates isolation between tasks
