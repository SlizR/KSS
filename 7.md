# Stack

**The stack** is a special memory area used to manage code execution.

### Why is it needed?

The stack is used to:

* store temporary data
* return from functions
* save execution state

### Why nothing works without a stack

Without a stack, it is impossible to:

* call functions nestedly
* handle interrupts
* save context

### Features

* the stack grows in a specific direction
* a stack error almost always results in a crash
* the stack must be one of the first to be initialized
