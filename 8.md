# Interrupts - How the System Responds to Events

Interrupts are an **asynchronous event mechanism**.

### What does this mean?

The processor doesn't ask devices:

> "Do you have an event?"

Devices **tell you**:

> "I need attention"

### Examples of Events

* Keystroke
* Timer Signal
* Device Operation Completion
* Hardware Error

### How an Interrupt Works

1. The processor stops its current operation
2. Saves its state
3. Transfers control to a handler
4. Returns after processing

### Why it's fundamental

Without interrupts:

* I/O is impossible
* Task scheduling is impossible
* The system would be "dead"
