# Processes — Execution as an Object

A process is **not just code**.

### A process includes

* processor state
* registers
* memory pointers
* stack
* execution context

### Why this is important

The kernel doesn't run "functions." It manages **execution entities**, each of which:

* can be suspended
* resumed
* switched

### Context

Context is everything that needs to be saved to continue execution **from exactly the same place**.
