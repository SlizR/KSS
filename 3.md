## What is GRUB?

**GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader)** is an **operating system bootloader**.
It acts as a "conduit" between turning on the computer and starting the kernel.

### GRUB's Main Function

When the computer turns on:

1. The device runs very simple code (BIOS/UEFI).
2. This code looks for a **bootloader**, such as GRUB.
3. GRUB loads the **kernel** into memory and transfers control to it.

In other words, **without a bootloader, the kernel cannot start**.

### Why is GRUB needed?

The computer itself doesn't know where the kernel is located on the disk. GRUB can:

* find the kernel on the disk
* pass it startup parameters
* select between multiple kernels or operating systems
* support booting from different devices (HDD, SSD, USB, network)

### How does GRUB work?

GRUB consists of several parts:

1. **Stage 1** — the minimal code at the very beginning of the disk.
It knows where to find Stage 2.

2. **Stage 2** — the main bootloader code.
It can:

* read file systems
* display the kernel selection menu
* load the kernel into memory

3. **Configuration file** — determines:

* which kernels are available
* command-line parameters for the kernel
* timer and selection menu

### GRUB Features

* **Kernel or OS selection**: you can have multiple kernel versions and select the one you need.
* **Passing parameters to the kernel**: for example, how much memory to use, which drivers to enable.
* **Works with different file systems**: FAT, NTFS, ext4, and others.
* **Command line mode**: allows you to manually load the kernel or fix errors.

### Why is GRUB used almost everywhere?

* Universal: supports different architectures and kernels.
* Flexible: you can add your own scripts and menus.
* Reliable: can correctly load the kernel even from multiple drives.

### A Brief Introduction to GRUB's Role

```text
BIOS/UEFI → GRUB → Kernel → Init/Userspace → Programs
```

* **BIOS/UEFI** — minimal startup code
* **GRUB** — finds and starts the kernel
* **Kernel** — manages the hardware
* **Init/Userspace** — starts the terminal, programs, and interfaces

Without GRUB (or another bootloader), the **kernel cannot start**.
