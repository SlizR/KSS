# **KSS Contribution**

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Kernel Step by Step (KSS)**. To maintain the high quality, clarity, and educational integrity of our documentation, all contributors must adhere to the following rules and procedures.

### **1. Scope of Contributions**

Contributions are strictly limited to the improvement and expansion of the documentation regarding Kernel and Operating System development.

* **Authorized Files:** You may only propose changes to documentation files following the naming convention `1.md`, `2.md`, ..., `[number].md`, as well as `README.md` and `menu.md`.
* **Unauthorized Contributions:** We do not accept direct contributions to source code examples (unless integrated into the documentation text), build scripts, or project infrastructure.

### **2. The Contribution Process (Fork & Pull Request)**

To ensure security and quality control, **direct commits to the main repository are prohibited.** You must follow the standard GitHub workflow:

1. **Fork** the official KSS repository to your own account.
2. **Create a new branch** for your specific changes.
3. **Commit your changes** to your fork.
4. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)** to the main KSS repository.
5. Wait for a manual review by the project maintainers.

### **3. Content and Style Requirements**

KSS is an educational resource built on the principles of logic and professional clarity.

* **Language:** All content must be written in **formal English**.
* **Tone:** The tone must be professional, technical, and objective.
* **Prohibitions:** The use of humor, slang, emojis, or unnecessary decorative elements is **strictly forbidden**.
* **Originality:** In line with our philosophy, all explanations must be original. Do not copy-paste from other resources or generate low-quality AI responses. Every sentence must contribute to the user's understanding of "Why" and "How."

### **4. Technical Accuracy**

Since KSS is a roadmap for building a system from scratch, accuracy is paramount. Ensure that:

* Any architectural logic described is technically sound.
* Instructions follow the sequential nature of the roadmap.
* Formatting remains consistent with the existing documentation structure.

### **5. Code of Conduct**

We value intellectual honesty. Contributions that promote "cloning and renaming" or the use of "stolen code" will be rejected. Our goal is to empower creators, not replicators.

**Failure to comply with these rules will result in the immediate closure of your Pull Request.**
